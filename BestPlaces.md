## Augsburg ; Germany

### `Augsburg` is the third largest city in Bavaria after Munich and Nuremberg.This ancient and famous imperial city was once the home of the two great medieval merchant dynasties of the Fuggers and the Welsers and is now the chief town of the administrative region of Bavarian Swabia (Bayerisch-Schwaben). Once connected with Verona by the Via Claudia, an ancient Roman road, Augsburg's favorable location promoted it as a center of commerce.

## The Best Places to visit in Augsburg are :

- `Augsburg Cathedral` (Augsburger Dom), a Roman Catholic structure built in the 11th century with additional features added later in the 14th century, is one of the city's top tourist draws. It's also one of Europe's more unusual cathedrals, largely due to its lack of a true façade, as well as its twin choirs

- `Augsburg Town Hall` . In the center of Augsburg stands the old Town Hall (Augsburger Rathaus). Completed in 1624, this massive Renaissance building is popular as much for its spectacular interior as for its exhibits relating to the city's rich and fascinating past

- `The Perlachturm`. If you're able to tackle a 261-step climb, then right across from the Town Hall is the equally interesting Perlachturm, a 10th-century watchtower with commanding views over the city from its observation deck

- `The Fuggerei` . The Fuggerei, a little "town within the town" in Augsburg, is a wonderful area to explore on foot. Enter through one of the community's four gates to see picturesque old homes, originally built to house the town's poorer Catholics. Founded by the Fugger family in 1521, the community consists of 67 buildings, 142 residences, and a church, and is the oldest social housing scheme in the world that's still in use

- `Mozarthaus Augsburg` Mozarthaus, located in the historic Fuggerei area of Augsburg, was where Leopold Mozart, the great composer's father and an accomplished musician himself was born in 1719. Now a fascinating museum, the attraction offers a glimpse into the life of the Mozart family. Exhibits include engravings, books, letters, and original musical scores, as well as a fine collection of historic musical instruments.

- `Maximilianstrasse and the Maximilian Museum`. `Maximilian Street` — or Maximilianstrasse — lies in the heart of Augsburg where the old Roman road connecting Germany and Italy began. It's a marvelous old street to wander along. It's also a great shopping destination, especially at night, and if you're in the mood for a memorable dining experience after a day of gallery and attraction hopping, there are numerous restaurants to choose from.
A fun thing to do on this historic street is pay a visit to the `Maximilian Museum` with its vivid portrayal of the history, art, and culture of Augsburg. Located in a palatial 16th-century former merchant's house, the museum's exhibits of decorative arts include sculptures, work by local gold and silversmiths, and artifacts from the town's rich history.
